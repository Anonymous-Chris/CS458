			<p>Nearly half of women and a third of men over the age of 45 will develop Parkinson's, dementia or stroke during their lifetime, a new study says.

			The three conditions are among the leading causes of mortality and disability in the older population, with global costs estimated to be 2% of the annual world gross domestic product.
			"Usually we hear about heart disease and about cancer but for some reason there is less focus on these diseases," said lead researcher Kamran Ikram, associate professor of neurology and epidemiology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

				Employer's paid period leave policy in Australia stirs world debate
			</ion-title>
				<img src="./assets/imgs/paid.jpg">
				<p>(CNN)At the Victorian Women's Trust offices in bustling Melbourne, Australia, the small staff of about 15 employees -- all women except for one -- talk openly about everything, even their menstrual cycles.

				The women's advocacy organization in Australia has been offering paid days off for painful periods, called "period leave" or "menstrual leave," to its employees for the past 18 months.
				These days do not count as "sick leave," but they are specifically provided for those monthly occasions when a woman might request to stay home due to having uncomfortable symptoms related to her menstrual cycle.
				Now, the organization is encouraging other employers to introduce similar menstrual policies, and it even provides a "menstrual policy template" for employers to download online to integrate into their own organizations.
